We're going to do more in-class hacking time to work together and y'all can set the tone. For example, the following scenarios would have been/can be great:

- the class corporately decides that everyone is going to do the exercises together _line by line_
- the group splits in two and each group works on alternating exercises and then the groups reconvene to talk each other through the opposite exercises

We could also try working in pairs, etc. The most important thing is no one feels left out. Points will be awarded for leadership, showing care/helpfulness, and fostering team work.
