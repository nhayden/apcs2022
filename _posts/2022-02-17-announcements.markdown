Important! Tomorrow (2/17) at a minimum I will *intro* the remaining topics needed for the exercises. Then the class decides on one of:

- allow time to get started on the exercises (and ask questions!) in class
- give deeper coverage to the topics (and skip starting the exercises in class)

All those planning to sit the AP CS test this spring will be delighted to hear we're picking up the pace with exercises :D (We have to increase the pace now to meet our schedule requirements.) I have **bolded** topics that are covered on the test for each exercise below. (This is a hilarious joke because all of them are on the test. Iteration alone makes up 17.5-22.5% of the test!)

Due next Weds (2/23):

- Bird Watcher (**arrays**, **iteration**): https://exercism.org/tracks/java/exercises/bird-watcher
  - Do this 1st or 2nd
- Cars, Assemble! (**primitives**, **casting**): https://exercism.org/tracks/java/exercises/cars-assemble
  - Do this 1st or 2nd
- Hamming (**strings**, **iteration**, **exceptions**, **`this` keyword**): https://exercism.org/tracks/java/exercises/hamming
- Difference of Squares (**iteration**): https://exercism.org/tracks/java/exercises/difference-of-squares
- Raindrops (**mod operator**, **strings**): https://exercism.org/tracks/java/exercises/raindrops
- **Extra credit** for Isogram (**strings**, **iteration**), but requires completing all the other exercises in this batch: https://exercism.org/tracks/java/exercises/isogram

Notes:

- Next Monday (2/21) the class can vote on one (1) of the above exercises to get covered in detail, but each student will still be required to submit their solution
  - This is a hint that you should make time Thurs and Fri to get started on them so you have an idea of what would be most helpful for Monday
- I encourage you to use IntelliJ to help while you're learning new stuff! Just remember that there won't be help on the test, so you have to actually know the stuff, can't rely on the IDE too much.
- So far the exercises have been comparatively simple. If you find yourself going beyond ~20 lines of code to solve an exercise that could be an indication you're working too hard!

<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
