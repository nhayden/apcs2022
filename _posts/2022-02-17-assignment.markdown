### Clarification for the preceding announcement

Apologies! I didn't realize next week school was out... the whole week ðŸ™ˆ Thanks to Mrs. Lew for the heads-up! (+1 point extra credit to Mrs. Lew).

These exercises are now instead due March 2 (because I want to make sure we have at least one more in-class chance to work on them before they're due). But, **significant** _extra credit_ will be awarded for submission by the original due date.

Further, **more exercises are forthcoming that will also be due March 2**.

Because of the reality that next week is lost for in-class instruction, we have to do more self-directed learning.

Mrs. Lew and I came up with this plan:

- Mrs. Lew and I will jointly be available for at least one hour for office hours (as discussed on the syllabus, via zoom) next week during one of the normal class times
- I will make time to be available additional hour(s) via zoom as requested
- More exercises are forthcoming that will also be due March 2
- As always (and yes, I've said this a million times now), Mrs. Lew and I are thrilled to get questions and help out. I'll be camping over the long weekend. But if I have ðŸ“¶ service I will still try to reply promptly
  - Note: please consult syllabus for what makes a good question, otherwise I might refer you to it
  - Use the resources exercism points you to, and the handouts/worksheets/video links/textbook/caveofprogramming/stackoverflow/etc. etc. etc. resources before you give up! ðŸ’ª

And lastly, feel free to work together; in fact it's encouraged! You'll get stuck less, feel more engaged, and remember more! But you are responsible for making sure you know the material.

Copying others' work without understanding it is a great way to get full marks on assignments yet fail all other assessments and the AP test ðŸ˜¬
